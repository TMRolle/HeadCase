# HeadCase

Headcase is a system for live, GPU accellerated control of large amounts of LED's in a positionally aware way.

It's programmed in C++ using OpenFrameworks, with shaders written in GLSL.

I didn't entirely expect to release this publically when I wrote it, so it's definitely a bit rough around the edges. I made this a couple years ago with OFX v0.9.8, so it'll probably require a little work to get it to compile - however, I decided I should put it here anyway, as maybe someone will find something in here useful.
